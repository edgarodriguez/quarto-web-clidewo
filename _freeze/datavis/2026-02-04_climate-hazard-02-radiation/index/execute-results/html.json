These effects can reduce work capacity and increase the likelihood of errors and injuries.\n\n**Long-term exposure** is strongly associated with non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers, premature skin aging, immune system suppression, and chronic eye conditions such as cataracts and pterygium. Repeated UV exposure over a working lifetime disproportionately affects agricultural workers, contributing to long-term health burdens, loss of income, and reduced quality of life.\n\nAddressing UV radiation through access to protective clothing, shaded rest areas, adjusted work schedules, and occupational health policies is essential to safeguard workers’ health and uphold decent work standards in agriculture.\n\n### UV Radiation score\n\nUV-Radiation is based on normalisation of the number \"High-UV\" days = daily dose ≥ 5.5 kJ/m²/day (Equivalent to UVI ≥ 8) (average 2021 to 2024) [^2]\n\nData visualization summarizes the analysis of excessive heat in **Brazil**, disaggregated by **municipality, population, and crops**, to identify spatial differences and heat stress hotspots across dimensions. By translating complex climate and socio-environmental data into accessible visual formats, data visualization supports better decision-making, enabling targeted interventions, risk prioritization, and policies that advance decent work in agriculture.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n![](img/02_viz_uv_radiation.png){width=100% height=100%}\n\n\n\n\n### Download {.appendix}\n\n\n{{< downloadthis img/viz_uv_radiation.pdf dname=clidewo_climate_hazard_uv_radiation label=\"Download the pdf\" icon=file-earmark-pdf type=Warning >}}\n\n\n---\n\n[^1]: International Labour Organization (ILO). *Ensuring safety and health at work in a changing climate*.
