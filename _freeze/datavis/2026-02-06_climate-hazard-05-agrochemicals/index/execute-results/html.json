These immediate impacts can lower productivity and raise accident rates, often without adequate access to rest, shade, or potable water.\n\n**Long-term exposure** to excessive heat is associated with chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular strain, worsening respiratory conditions, and long-lasting impacts on mental health. Repeated heat stress can also accelerate physical wear, shorten working lives, and increase economic insecurity among already vulnerable workers.\n\nAddressing heat stress through regulation, social protection, and workplace adaptation is essential to ensure decent work, protect health, and sustain agricultural livelihoods in a warming climate.\n\n### Our Agrochemicals Score\n\n\nAgrochemicals score is estimated by integrating two indicators: Application of pesticides [^2], and Pesticides Risk Score [^3].\n\n\nData visualization summarizes the analysis of excessive heat in **Brazil**, disaggregated by **municipality, population, and crops**, to identify spatial differences and heat stress hotspots across dimensions. By translating complex climate and socio-environmental data into accessible visual formats, data visualization supports better decision-making, enabling targeted interventions, risk prioritization, and policies that advance decent work in agriculture.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n![](img/02_viz_agrochemicals.png){width=100% height=100%}\n\n\n\n\n### Download {.appendix}\n\n\n{{< downloadthis img/viz_agrochemicals.pdf dname=clidewo_climate_hazard_agrochemicals label=\"Download the pdf\" icon=file-earmark-pdf type=Warning >}}\n\n\n---\n\n[^1]: International Labour Organization (ILO). *Ensuring safety and health at work in a changing climate*.
