These immediate impacts can lower productivity and raise accident rates, often without adequate access to rest, shade, or potable water.\n\n**Long-term exposure** to excessive heat is associated with chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular strain, worsening respiratory conditions, and long-lasting impacts on mental health. Repeated heat stress can also accelerate physical wear, shorten working lives, and increase economic insecurity among already vulnerable workers.\n\nAddressing heat stress through regulation, social protection, and workplace adaptation is essential to ensure decent work, protect health, and sustain agricultural livelihoods in a warming climate.\n\n### Our Excessive Heat Score\n\n\nThe **excessive heat score** is estimated by integrating three indicators: the **Wet Bulb Global Temperature (WBGT) 5-year period return**[^2], **maximum WBGT**[^3], and **accumulated heat waves**, defined as periods of at least three consecutive days of excessive heat[^4]. This composite metric captures the intensity, frequency, and persistence of heat exposure, aligning with international frameworks on occupational safety and health in the context of climate change[^1].\n\nData visualization summarizes the analysis of excessive heat in **Brazil**, disaggregated by **municipality, population, and crops**, to identify spatial differences and heat stress hotspots across dimensions. By translating complex climate and socio-environmental data into accessible visual formats, data visualization supports better decision-making, enabling targeted interventions, risk prioritization, and policies that advance decent work in agriculture.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n![](img/01_viz_excessive_heat.png){width=100% height=100%}\n\n\n\n\n### Download {.appendix}\n\n\n{{< downloadthis img/01_viz_excessive_heat.pdf dname=clidewo_climate_hazard_excessive_heat label=\"Download the pdf\" icon=file-earmark-pdf type=Warning >}}\n\n\n---\n\n[^1]: International Labour Organization (ILO). *Ensuring safety and health at work in a changing climate*.
