In general, the impact of climate change on decent work is most acute in the agricultural sector, where Brazil represents a typical case as it is a large exporter of agricultural goods. The project will produce a worker-informed, data- driven climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) for agricultural workers in Brazil with respect to climate hazards and will assess how indecent work practices exacerbate vulnerability and decrease occupational health. By applying an innovative multi-layer risk assessment approach that integrates climate models, socio-economic data, and qualitative worker voice data, the project provides valuable insights towards the development of targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies. This project supports the broader aspirations for achieving decent work conditions, as set out in UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8."

Entretanto, raramente esses dados se transformam em informações úteis à tomada de decisões a respeito de questões de alta complexidade que marcam a atualidade e que exigem intervenções baseadas em evidências e orientadas para resultados. Por outro lado, a formulação, o monitoramento e a avaliação de programas, projetos e políticas públicas são processos que exigem informações. Nesse contexto, a iniciativa SmarlLab surgiu para construir conhecimento relevante para políticas públicas de promoção do trabalho decente com o uso de um recurso público de baixíssimo custo: dados públicos abertos. A iniciativa conjunta do MPT e da OIT Brasil deu origem à Plataforma SmartLab, que tem fortalecido a cooperação com organizações governamentais, não-governamentais e internacionais que atuam na promoção dessa agenda e que precisam de informações para tomar decisões sobre as ações que desenvolvem. Por meio de Observatórios Digitais, a plataforma beneficia também a comunidade científica, que passa a ter acesso a informações com facilidade sem precedentes para pesquisa. Além disso, o fluxo público de informações para tomada de decisões baseadas em evidências e orientadas para resultados beneficia a sociedade civil em geral."

    "text": "Why Distill and giscus?\nLike many R-bloggers these days, I have made some changes: I switched from blogdown to Distill 2, and from disqus to utterances 3. Several things about utterances appealed to me: free, open-source, no data tracking. But when I started using it, I immediately was turned off by the dual use of GitHub issues as a way to store comments. It just felt odd to have an issue that wasn’t an issue!\nFortunately, I’m not the only one to feel this way, and @laymonage actually did something about it: there is now a very similar app to utterances, called giscus. It offers almost the same functionality, but it uses GitHub Discussions as the place to store comments instead of Issues. This makes much more sense to me."

    "title": "Enable giscus in Distill",
    "section": "How to set up giscus on Distill",
    "text": "How to set up giscus on Distill\nThere are several blogposts 4 on how to enable utterances on Distill, but none that I’ve found so far on giscus. So, here goes!\n\nEnable Discussions on your blog repo. Optionally, if you want to use a non-default Discussions category for storing giscus content, add a new category. I did this and called it “Comments”. As recommended by giscus, it’s a good idea to set the discussion format to “Announcement” so that non-authorized users can’t add content via the Discussions interface (only the giscus widget on your blog).\nInstall the giscus GitHub app and configure it to have access to your blog’s repo.\nGo to the giscus app interface, scroll down to “configuration” and fill in the details for your blog. Once you’ve done so, further down you should see an HTML code block under “Enable giscus” populated with your information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 2: giscus configuration menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 3: giscus HTML block. Once you fill in the fields in the configuration menu, the parts starting with [ENTER ...] will get automatically populated.\n\n\n\nAs described in Miles McBain’s blogpost, unfortunately in Distill, you can’t just paste the HTML directly into an Rmd file. It won’t show up. But the same work-around that he describes for utterances also happily works for giscus! Read on…\n\nAdd an .html file (I’ve called mine giscus.html) to the root of your blog repo that looks like this (and is based off of Miles’ HTML):\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n   document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function () {\n     if (!/posts/.test(location.pathname)) {\n       return;\n     }\n\n     var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n     script.src = \"https://giscus.app/client.js\";\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-repo\", \"[ENTER REPO HERE]\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-repo-id\", \"[ENTER REPO ID HERE]\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-category\", \"[ENTER CATEGORY NAME HERE]\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-category-id\", \"[ENTER CATEGORY ID HERE]\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-mapping\", \"pathname\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-reactions-enabled\", \"0\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-emit-metadata\", \"0\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-theme\", \"light\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-lang\", \"en\");\n\n     /* wait for article to load, append script to article element */\n     var observer = new MutationObserver(function (mutations, observer) {\n       var article = document.querySelector(\"d-article\");\n       if (article) {\n         observer.disconnect();\n         /* HACK: article scroll */\n         article.setAttribute(\"style\", \"overflow-y: hidden\");\n         article.appendChild(script);\n       }\n     });\n\n     observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true });\n   });\n &lt;/script&gt;\nIf you compare the above code with the HTML block in the giscus app (Figura 3), you should be able to see how the script.setAttribute lines above map to the key-value pairs in the HTML block in the giscus app. All we have to do is copy the contents of the HTML block over to this giscus.html file. You can see what my giscus.html file looks like here.\n\nModify _site.yml so that the giscus.html file gets loaded on every Distill article page 5:\n\noutput: \n  distill::distill_article:\n    includes:\n      in_header: giscus.html\nThat’s it! Or it should be anyways. I recommend trying a test comment to make sure everything is working (nobody will tell you otherwise…)"

In a nutshell, Distill is much simpler to use than blogdown, at the cost of some design flexibility. For more about making the switch, you can get caught up with posts from Thomas Mock, Frie Preu, Lisa Lendway, and Andreas Handel.↩︎\ndisqus and utterances are tools that let users comment on blog posts. Recently many R-bloggers have been moving away from disqus because it has a habit of tracking user’s data and causing page bloat. More recently, when I checked on my disqus account (in the process of migrating away!), it had a option to “opt-out” of data tracking, but that means data-tracking is on by default.↩︎\nFor example, Vebash Naidoo’s tutorial and Michael McCarthy’s post describing how to control the location of the comments section.↩︎\nThe _site.yml file is longer than this, but I’m just showing the relevant code to add.

The project will produce a worker-informed, data-driven climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) for agricultural workers in Brazil concerning climate hazards. It will assess how indecent work practices exacerbate vulnerability and decrease occupational health. The project provides valuable insights towards developing targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies by applying a multi-layer risk assessment approach that integrates climate models, socio-economic data, and qualitative data from participatory methods such as worker voice data. This project supports the broader aspirations for achieving decent work conditions, as set out in UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, and linked with SDG 3, improving agricultural workers’ overall health and well-being.\nFunder: British Academy’s ODA Challenge-Oriented Research Grants 2024 Programme Duration: 18 months (June 24 to Dec 25)\nRights Lab project lead: Edgar Rodríguez-Huerta Programme: Measurement and Geographies\n\nProject press release\n\n\nThis is an example to check website"
