In general, the impact of climate change on decent work is most acute in the agricultural sector, where Brazil represents a typical case as it is a large exporter of agricultural goods. The project will produce a worker-informed, data- driven climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) for agricultural workers in Brazil with respect to climate hazards and will assess how indecent work practices exacerbate vulnerability and decrease occupational health. By applying an innovative multi-layer risk assessment approach that integrates climate models, socio-economic data, and qualitative worker voice data, the project provides valuable insights towards the development of targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies. This project supports the broader aspirations for achieving decent work conditions, as set out in UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8."

We will produce actionable inferences for key stakeholders and policymakers aimed at improving climate risk mitigation strategies in agricultural work and developing adaptation strategies for workers affected by climate change."

This will identify vulnerable areas where targeted interventions can help to mitigate the effects of climate change. The project’s novel, innovative, and integrated methods, data, and analysis will support these more targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies."

    "text": "How to set up giscus on Distill\nThere are several blogposts 4 on how to enable utterances on Distill, but none that I’ve found so far on giscus. So, here goes!\n\nEnable Discussions on your blog repo. Optionally, if you want to use a non-default Discussions category for storing giscus content, add a new category. I did this and called it “Comments”. As recommended by giscus, it’s a good idea to set the discussion format to “Announcement” so that non-authorized users can’t add content via the Discussions interface (only the giscus widget on your blog).\nInstall the giscus GitHub app and configure it to have access to your blog’s repo.\nGo to the giscus app interface, scroll down to “configuration” and fill in the details for your blog. Once you’ve done so, further down you should see an HTML code block under “Enable giscus” populated with your information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 2: giscus configuration menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 3: giscus HTML block. Once you fill in the fields in the configuration menu, the parts starting with [ENTER ...] will get automatically populated.\n\n\n\nAs described in Miles McBain’s blogpost, unfortunately in Distill, you can’t just paste the HTML directly into an Rmd file. It won’t show up. But the same work-around that he describes for utterances also happily works for giscus! Read on…\n\nAdd an .html file (I’ve called mine giscus.html) to the root of your blog repo that looks like this (and is based off of Miles’ HTML):\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n   document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function () {\n     if (!/posts/.test(location.pathname)) {\n       return;\n     }\n\n     var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n     script.src = \"https://giscus.app/client.js\";\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-repo\", \"[ENTER REPO HERE]\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-repo-id\", \"[ENTER REPO ID HERE]\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-category\", \"[ENTER CATEGORY NAME HERE]\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-category-id\", \"[ENTER CATEGORY ID HERE]\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-mapping\", \"pathname\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-reactions-enabled\", \"0\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-emit-metadata\", \"0\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-theme\", \"light\");\n     script.setAttribute(\"data-lang\", \"en\");\n\n     /* wait for article to load, append script to article element */\n     var observer = new MutationObserver(function (mutations, observer) {\n       var article = document.querySelector(\"d-article\");\n       if (article) {\n         observer.disconnect();\n         /* HACK: article scroll */\n         article.setAttribute(\"style\", \"overflow-y: hidden\");\n         article.appendChild(script);\n       }\n     });\n\n     observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true });\n   });\n &lt;/script&gt;\nIf you compare the above code with the HTML block in the giscus app (Figura 3), you should be able to see how the script.setAttribute lines above map to the key-value pairs in the HTML block in the giscus app. All we have to do is copy the contents of the HTML block over to this giscus.html file. You can see what my giscus.html file looks like here.\n\nModify _site.yml so that the giscus.html file gets loaded on every Distill article page 5:\n\noutput: \n  distill::distill_article:\n    includes:\n      in_header: giscus.html\nThat’s it! Or it should be anyways. I recommend trying a test comment to make sure everything is working (nobody will tell you otherwise…)"

In a nutshell, Distill is much simpler to use than blogdown, at the cost of some design flexibility. For more about making the switch, you can get caught up with posts from Thomas Mock, Frie Preu, Lisa Lendway, and Andreas Handel.↩︎\ndisqus and utterances are tools that let users comment on blog posts. Recently many R-bloggers have been moving away from disqus because it has a habit of tracking user’s data and causing page bloat. More recently, when I checked on my disqus account (in the process of migrating away!), it had a option to “opt-out” of data tracking, but that means data-tracking is on by default.↩︎\nFor example, Vebash Naidoo’s tutorial and Michael McCarthy’s post describing how to control the location of the comments section.↩︎\nThe _site.yml file is longer than this, but I’m just showing the relevant code to add. You can see my _site.yml file here.↩︎"

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nI have converted my website to Quarto.↩︎\nblogdown and Distill are R packages for making websites. In a nutshell, Distill is much simpler to use than blogdown, at the cost of some design flexibility. For more about making the switch, you can get caught up with posts from Thomas Mock, Frie Preu, Lisa Lendway, and Andreas Handel.↩︎\ndisqus and utterances are tools that let users comment on blog posts. Recently many R-bloggers have been moving away from disqus because it has a habit of tracking user’s data and causing page bloat. More recently, when I checked on my disqus account (in the process of migrating away!), it had a option to “opt-out” of data tracking, but that means data-tracking is on by default.↩︎\nFor example, Vebash Naidoo’s tutorial and Michael McCarthy’s post describing how to control the location of the comments section.↩︎\nThe _site.yml file is longer than this, but I’m just showing the relevant code to add. You can see my _site.yml file here.↩︎"

This work is deeply interdisciplinary and draws insights and tools from various areas of social science, computer science, statistics, and medicine.\nHe completed his doctoral training under the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Cohn (nonverbal behavior, machine learning, depression) and Dr. Aidan Wright (interpersonal functioning, statistics, personality). He then completed his predoctoral clinical internship at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (inpatient psychiatry, trauma treatment, neuropsychology) and a two-year postdoctoral research fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University under the mentorship of Dr. Louis-Philippe Morency (verbal behavior, machine learning, computer science).\nHe is now an Assistant Professor in the department of Psychology at the University of Kansas, where he directs the Affective Communication and Computing lab and the Brain, Behavior, and Quantitative Science (BBQ) program. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on psychological assessment, data science, and statistics within the department and is a co-founder of SMaRT Workshops, which offers numerous methodological training workshops to faculty and students. He is also the developer and maintainer of numerous open-source research software packages (see Resources)."
