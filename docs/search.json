In general, the impact of climate change on decent work is most acute in the agricultural sector, where Brazil represents a typical case as it is a large exporter of agricultural goods. The project will produce a worker-informed, data- driven climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) for agricultural workers in Brazil with respect to climate hazards and will assess how indecent work practices exacerbate vulnerability and decrease occupational health. By applying an innovative multi-layer risk assessment approach that integrates climate models, socio-economic data, and qualitative worker voice data, the project provides valuable insights towards the development of targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies. This project supports the broader aspirations for achieving decent work conditions, as set out in UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8."
