It serves as a foundational step toward identifying causal relationships and improving surveillance mechanisms and risk assessments. By integrating public health data with labour inspections, the study aims to enhance inspection coverage, foster multi-stakeholder collaboration, and strengthen efforts to address labour exploitation and health vulnerabilities simultaneously.\nIf you’re attending, I’d love to connect!\n\nShare this post on social media:"

The project will produce a worker-informed, data-driven climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) for agricultural workers in Brazil concerning climate hazards. It will assess how indecent work practices exacerbate vulnerability and decrease occupational health. The project provides valuable insights towards developing targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies by applying a multi-layer risk assessment approach that integrates climate models, socio-economic data, and qualitative data from participatory methods such as worker voice data. This project supports the broader aspirations for achieving decent work conditions, as set out in UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, and linked with SDG 3, improving agricultural workers’ overall health and well-being.\nFunder: British Academy’s ODA Challenge-Oriented Research Grants 2024 Programme\nDuration: 18 months (June 24 to Dec 25)\n\nProject press release\n\n\nShare this post on social media:"

    "text": "Biografia\n\n\n\n\nPedro Igor Galvão é bolsista Early Career Fellow do British Council e integrante do programa Measurement and Geographies do Rights Lab (Universidade de Nottingham). Sua pesquisa investiga como o trabalho análogo à escravidão e o desmatamento na Amazônia Legal brasileira se expressam espacialmente por meio de transformações desiguais da paisagem. Ele integra ferramentas de SIG, imagens de satélite e indicadores socioambientais para avaliar correlações entre uso do solo, exploração e injustiça territorial. É graduado em Arquitetura e Urbanismo e está concluindo o mestrado em Ciências do Ambiente pela Universidade Federal do Tocantins (UFT), onde pesquisa a paisagem como produto e instrumento da produção social do espaço. Seu trabalho evidencia como o legado colonial brasileiro se inscreve nos padrões espaciais de segregação, exploração e desigualdade socioambiental. Desde 2018, Pedro atua como pesquisador no Instituto de Atenção às Cidades (IAC/UFT), onde tem coordenado e colaborado em projetos de planejamento e gestão territorial em contextos urbanos e rurais. Sua experiência inclui a elaboração de Planos de Mobilidade Urbana Sustentável (PlanMobs), Planos Diretores Municipais, Relatórios de Licenciamento Ambiental e masterplans em escala regional. Essas iniciativas integram pesquisa acadêmica, consultoria técnica e métodos participativos para apoiar a governança territorial democrática e a justiça espacial."

    "text": "Enslaved in Ethanol\nEthanol is widely recognized as a important solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in transport sector and combating climate change. As the second-largest ethanol producer, Brazil plays a significant role in the global biofuel industry. However, despite its environmental benefits, ethanol production raises serious concerns regarding labour rights, occupational health, and social justice. The recent report Enslaved in Ethanol by Reportér Brasil highlights the exploitation and unsafe working conditions faced by sugarcane workers.\n\n“The situations reported in sugarcane fields linked to their operations include workers killed in fires, forced to sleep on the ground, unable to leave their jobs because of illegal debts imposed by their employers, and even hit by pesticides dropped from airplanes.”\n\nMany workers are subjected to debt bondage and unpredictable wages due to unfair deductions, paying for their own travel, accommodation, and food. Additionally, extreme working hours and lack of formal contracts deny workers access to essential social security benefits. Some workers report sleeping only four hours a night, as long commutes and exhausting shifts make proper rest impossible. Moreover, sugarcane workers are frequently exposed to hazardous pesticides, experience severe physical effort, and high risks of heat-related illnesses.\n\n“Workers reported to inspectors that they had been sprayed on with pesticides. The plane that allegedly did the spraying can be seen in the photo taken by one of them on his cell phone.”\n\n\n\n\nSource: Enslaved in Ethanol. Workers reported to inspectors that they had been sprayed on with pesticides\n\n\nAddressing these challenges requires stronger enforcement of labour laws, greater corporate accountability, and improved oversight in supply chains. A just transition in the ethanol industry must prioritize not only environmental sustainability but also the protection of workers’ rights and well-being. Governments, companies, and financial institutions must take decisive action to eliminate modern slavery, ensure fair wages, and provide safe working conditions. Ethanol may be a cleaner fuel alternative, but it must not come at the cost of human lives, dignity and fundamental labour rights.\n\n\nShare it on social media:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

This will identify vulnerable areas where targeted interventions can help to mitigate the effects of climate change. The project’s novel, innovative, and integrated methods, data, and analysis will support these more targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies."

    "text": "Today at #COP30, the theme of Health, Jobs, Justice, and Human Rights highlights how these topics are deeply interconnected. The effects of climate-related hazards significantly affect agriculture and disproportionately impact those who are already disadvantaged due to factors such as poverty, discrimination, gender and income inequalities, and limited access to resources. Integrating workers’ health and decent work into the climate change impacts on agriculture is essential, as vulnerabilities exacerbate socio-economic disparities and increase climate risks. Without support for adaptation, these vulnerabilities can intensify.\nIn our work Climate change, decent work and workers’ health in Brazil: theoretical considerations, we highlighted the challenges, limitations, and knowledge gaps related to agricultural labour, worker health, and the increasing influence of climate change in Brazil.\nYou can read the PRESS RELEASE here!\n#WorkersHealth #HumanRights #DecentWork #ClimateAction #Brazil\n\nShare it on social media:"

His research explores how forced labour and deforestation in the Brazilian Legal Amazon are spatially expressed through unequal landscape transformations. He integrates GIS, satellite imagery, and socio-environmental indicators to assess correlations between land use, exploitation, and territorial injustice. He holds a degree in Architecture and Urbanism and is completing a Master’s in Environmental Sciences at the Federal University of Tocantins (UFT), where he investigates landscape as both product and instrument of the social production of space. His work reveals how Brazil’s colonial legacy is inscribed in spatial patterns of segregation, exploitation, and socio-environmental inequality. Since 2018, Pedro has worked as a researcher at the Instituto de Atenção às Cidades (IAC/UFT), where he has coordinated and contributed to planning and territorial management projects across urban and rural contexts. His experience includes the development of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (PlanMobs), Municipal Master Plans, Environmental Licensing Reports, and regional-scale masterplans. These initiatives integrate academic research, technical consultancy, and participatory methods to support democratic territorial governance and spatial justice."
