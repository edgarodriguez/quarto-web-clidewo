    "text": "National Workshop in Brasília Debates Climate Change, Health, and Labor in Brazilian Agriculture\nOn February 5th and 6th, Brasília hosted the National Workshop on Climate Change and Labor in Brazilian Agriculture: Worker Health, Human Rights, and Institutional Responses. The event brought together researchers, public officials, judicial representatives, and members of social and labor movements. This initiative is part of a collaborative research project involving the Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), Universidade Federal do Maranhão (UFMA), and Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso (UFMT), alongside the University of Nottingham, Rights Lab, and with the support of The British Academy.\nThe workshop aimed to foster cross-sector dialogue regarding the impact of climate change on the working conditions and health of agricultural laborers. These discussions are intended to shape public policies grounded in the principles of climate justice, human rights, and decent work standards.\nThe programme included the presentation of research findings by Edgar Rodriguez-Huerta (University of Nottingham), as well as two thematic panels addressing the contemporary challenges of the climate crisis and agricultural labour. The first panel examined COP30 as a catalyst for institutional responses to the climate crisis. The second panel focused on living and working conditions in agriculture, discussing topics such as the Climate Plan, the impacts of extreme heat, the risks associated with pesticide use, and the effects of climate change on the health of rural workers. The organisers thank the moderators, panellists and participants for their valuable contributions.\nOver the two-day event, participants organized into working groups to discuss local realities, the specific effects of climate change, and the ongoing challenges in protecting the rights and health of rural workers. These deliberations will serve as the foundation for a formal report featuring recommendations to strengthen public policies in the sector.\nThe event strengthened cooperation networks between universities, the State, and civil society, reinforcing a collective front against the challenges imposed by the climate crisis. Congratulations to the research team who led the organization, debates, and activities: Isabel Domingos, Flávia Moura, Carla Reita, Ludmila Paiva, Laert Moraes, Manuella Gallego, Mayara Fortes, Saulo da Costa, Ivi Castillero, Mariana Soares e Kesley Coutinho.

As a result, each municipality is assigned a score from 0 to 100, with the higher the value, the greater the vulnerability.\nThe index allows the comparison of the vulnerability of municipalities with a comprehensive view, based on an analysis for the set of subindices, or can be observed separately and isolated for each mapped cliff.\nThe IVCM is part of Climate Action, an initiative of the Votorantim Institute in partnership with CBA and the Itaúsa Institute. We also make part of a preparation checklist for climate changes and a public management support and strengthening program, or AGP Climate Action."

We only consider entries classified with the occupational classification “6; Trabalhadores Agropecuários”, Brazilian Classification of Occupations in occupational status (CBO). We derived the number of agricultural workers from the Agricultural Censuses (Tabelas 1113 and 6884 for 2006 and 2017, respectively).\nSIHSUS hospital admission rates filtered by working-age population (15–64 years), as a proxy measure for incidence as per the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10), at the municipality level between 2003 and 2024, using a selection of 900 ICD-10 climate-related diseases regarding morbidity related to five key occupational health risks outlined in “Health at Work in a Changing-Climate” (ILO, 2024), (excessive heat, air pollution, UV radiation, vector-borne diseases[1], and agrochemical exposure), plus waterborne diseases as lack of proper WASH facilities was detected as one of the main issues detected in labour inspection. Although ICDs cannot be entirely attributed to climate-related factors, we have included them in the analysis, considering a narrative literature review and official occupational health information from the Brazilian. Then adjusted incidence rates using age-adjusted rates, reflecting the Brazilian average population from 2003 to 2020 as the standard population.\n\n\nShare it on social media:"

    "text": "Biografia\n\n\n\n\nPedro Igor Galvão é bolsista Early Career Fellow do British Council e integrante do programa Measurement and Geographies do Rights Lab (Universidade de Nottingham). Sua pesquisa investiga como o trabalho análogo à escravidão e o desmatamento na Amazônia Legal brasileira se expressam espacialmente por meio de transformações desiguais da paisagem. Ele integra ferramentas de SIG, imagens de satélite e indicadores socioambientais para avaliar correlações entre uso do solo, exploração e injustiça territorial. É graduado em Arquitetura e Urbanismo e está concluindo o mestrado em Ciências do Ambiente pela Universidade Federal do Tocantins (UFT), onde pesquisa a paisagem como produto e instrumento da produção social do espaço. Seu trabalho evidencia como o legado colonial brasileiro se inscreve nos padrões espaciais de segregação, exploração e desigualdade socioambiental. Desde 2018, Pedro atua como pesquisador no Instituto de Atenção às Cidades (IAC/UFT), onde tem coordenado e colaborado em projetos de planejamento e gestão territorial em contextos urbanos e rurais. Sua experiência inclui a elaboração de Planos de Mobilidade Urbana Sustentável (PlanMobs), Planos Diretores Municipais, Relatórios de Licenciamento Ambiental e masterplans em escala regional. Essas iniciativas integram pesquisa acadêmica, consultoria técnica e métodos participativos para apoiar a governança territorial democrática e a justiça espacial."

    "text": "Enslaved in Ethanol\nEthanol is widely recognized as a important solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in transport sector and combating climate change. As the second-largest ethanol producer, Brazil plays a significant role in the global biofuel industry. However, despite its environmental benefits, ethanol production raises serious concerns regarding labour rights, occupational health, and social justice. The recent report Enslaved in Ethanol by Reportér Brasil highlights the exploitation and unsafe working conditions faced by sugarcane workers.\n\n“The situations reported in sugarcane fields linked to their operations include workers killed in fires, forced to sleep on the ground, unable to leave their jobs because of illegal debts imposed by their employers, and even hit by pesticides dropped from airplanes.”\n\nMany workers are subjected to debt bondage and unpredictable wages due to unfair deductions, paying for their own travel, accommodation, and food. Additionally, extreme working hours and lack of formal contracts deny workers access to essential social security benefits. Some workers report sleeping only four hours a night, as long commutes and exhausting shifts make proper rest impossible. Moreover, sugarcane workers are frequently exposed to hazardous pesticides, experience severe physical effort, and high risks of heat-related illnesses.\n\n“Workers reported to inspectors that they had been sprayed on with pesticides. The plane that allegedly did the spraying can be seen in the photo taken by one of them on his cell phone.”\n\n\n\n\nSource: Enslaved in Ethanol. Workers reported to inspectors that they had been sprayed on with pesticides\n\n\nAddressing these challenges requires stronger enforcement of labour laws, greater corporate accountability, and improved oversight in supply chains. A just transition in the ethanol industry must prioritize not only environmental sustainability but also the protection of workers’ rights and well-being. Governments, companies, and financial institutions must take decisive action to eliminate modern slavery, ensure fair wages, and provide safe working conditions. Ethanol may be a cleaner fuel alternative, but it must not come at the cost of human lives, dignity and fundamental labour rights.\n\n\nShare it on social media:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

The project will produce a worker-informed, data-driven climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) for agricultural workers in Brazil concerning climate hazards. It will assess how indecent work practices exacerbate vulnerability and decrease occupational health. The project provides valuable insights towards developing targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies by applying a multi-layer risk assessment approach that integrates climate models, socio-economic data, and qualitative data from participatory methods such as worker voice data. This project supports the broader aspirations for achieving decent work conditions, as set out in UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, and linked with SDG 3, improving agricultural workers’ overall health and well-being.\nFunder: British Academy’s ODA Challenge-Oriented Research Grants 2024 Programme\nDuration: 18 months (June 24 to Dec 25)\n\nProject press release\n\n\nShare this post on social media:"

The effects of climate-related hazards significantly affect agriculture and disproportionately impact those who are already disadvantaged due to factors such as poverty, discrimination, gender and income inequalities, and limited access to resources. Integrating workers’ health and decent work into the climate change impacts on agriculture is essential, as vulnerabilities exacerbate socio-economic disparities and increase climate risks. Without support for adaptation, these vulnerabilities can intensify.\nIn our work Climate change, decent work and workers’ health in Brazil: theoretical considerations, we highlighted the challenges, limitations, and knowledge gaps related to agricultural labour, worker health, and the increasing influence of climate change in Brazil.\nYou can read the PRESS RELEASE here!\n#WorkersHealth #HumanRights #DecentWork #ClimateAction #Brazil\n\nShare it on social media:"

    "text": "Biography\n\n\n\n\nPedro Igor Galvão is a British Council Early Career Fellow and a member of the Measurement and Geographies Programme at the Rights Lab (University of Nottingham). His research explores how forced labour and deforestation in the Brazilian Legal Amazon are spatially expressed through unequal landscape transformations. He integrates GIS, satellite imagery, and socio-environmental indicators to assess correlations between land use, exploitation, and territorial injustice. He holds a degree in Architecture and Urbanism and is completing a Master’s in Environmental Sciences at the Federal University of Tocantins (UFT), where he investigates landscape as both product and instrument of the social production of space. His work reveals how Brazil’s colonial legacy is inscribed in spatial patterns of segregation, exploitation, and socio-environmental inequality. Since 2018, Pedro has worked as a researcher at the Instituto de Atenção às Cidades (IAC/UFT), where he has coordinated and contributed to planning and territorial management projects across urban and rural contexts. His experience includes the development of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (PlanMobs), Municipal Master Plans, Environmental Licensing Reports, and regional-scale masterplans. These initiatives integrate academic research, technical consultancy, and participatory methods to support democratic territorial governance and spatial justice."
