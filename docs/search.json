The project will produce a worker-informed, data-driven climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) for agricultural workers in Brazil concerning climate hazards. It will assess how indecent work practices exacerbate vulnerability and decrease occupational health. The project provides valuable insights towards developing targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies by applying a multi-layer risk assessment approach that integrates climate models, socio-economic data, and qualitative data from participatory methods such as worker voice data. This project supports the broader aspirations for achieving decent work conditions, as set out in UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, and linked with SDG 3, improving agricultural workers’ overall health and well-being.\nFunder: British Academy’s ODA Challenge-Oriented Research Grants 2024 Programme\nDuration: 18 months (June 24 to Dec 25)\n\nProject press release\n\n\nShare this post on social media:"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Enslaved in Ethanol\nEthanol is widely recognized as a important solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in transport sector and combating climate change. As the second-largest ethanol producer, Brazil plays a significant role in the global biofuel industry. However, despite its environmental benefits, ethanol production raises serious concerns regarding labour rights, occupational health, and social justice. The recent report Enslaved in Ethanol by Reportér Brasil highlights the exploitation and unsafe working conditions faced by sugarcane workers.\n\n“The situations reported in sugarcane fields linked to their operations include workers killed in fires, forced to sleep on the ground, unable to leave their jobs because of illegal debts imposed by their employers, and even hit by pesticides dropped from airplanes.”\n\nMany workers are subjected to debt bondage and unpredictable wages due to unfair deductions, paying for their own travel, accommodation, and food. Additionally, extreme working hours and lack of formal contracts deny workers access to essential social security benefits. Some workers report sleeping only four hours a night, as long commutes and exhausting shifts make proper rest impossible. Moreover, sugarcane workers are frequently exposed to hazardous pesticides, experience severe physical effort, and high risks of heat-related illnesses.\n\n“Workers reported to inspectors that they had been sprayed on with pesticides. The plane that allegedly did the spraying can be seen in the photo taken by one of them on his cell phone.”\n\n\n\n\nSource: Enslaved in Ethanol. Workers reported to inspectors that they had been sprayed on with pesticides\n\n\nAddressing these challenges requires stronger enforcement of labour laws, greater corporate accountability, and improved oversight in supply chains. A just transition in the ethanol industry must prioritize not only environmental sustainability but also the protection of workers’ rights and well-being. Governments, companies, and financial institutions must take decisive action to eliminate modern slavery, ensure fair wages, and provide safe working conditions. Ethanol may be a cleaner fuel alternative, but it must not come at the cost of human lives, dignity and fundamental labour rights.\n\n\nShare it on social media:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

Sua pesquisa investiga como o trabalho análogo à escravidão e o desmatamento na Amazônia Legal brasileira se expressam espacialmente por meio de transformações desiguais da paisagem. Ele integra ferramentas de SIG, imagens de satélite e indicadores socioambientais para avaliar correlações entre uso do solo, exploração e injustiça territorial. É graduado em Arquitetura e Urbanismo e está concluindo o mestrado em Ciências do Ambiente pela Universidade Federal do Tocantins (UFT), onde pesquisa a paisagem como produto e instrumento da produção social do espaço. Seu trabalho evidencia como o legado colonial brasileiro se inscreve nos padrões espaciais de segregação, exploração e desigualdade socioambiental. Desde 2018, Pedro atua como pesquisador no Instituto de Atenção às Cidades (IAC/UFT), onde tem coordenado e colaborado em projetos de planejamento e gestão territorial em contextos urbanos e rurais. Sua experiência inclui a elaboração de Planos de Mobilidade Urbana Sustentável (PlanMobs), Planos Diretores Municipais, Relatórios de Licenciamento Ambiental e masterplans em escala regional. Essas iniciativas integram pesquisa acadêmica, consultoria técnica e métodos participativos para apoiar a governança territorial democrática e a justiça espacial."

It was enjoyable to revisit LEGO — now to continue exploring new ways to share research.\nWe are working to produce a worker-informed, data-driven climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) for agricultural workers in Brazil. Each coloured LEGO layer represents a vital piece of the puzzle: climate data, socioeconomic conditions, and workers’ voices. By applying a multi-layer risk assessment, the project will provide insights into the relationship between climate change, workers’ health, and decent work.\nA big thank you to Andrew Rowe for introducing such a great initiative.\nSorry for the terrible map, but I ran out of time and green blocks 😅\n\n\nShare it on social media:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

The effects of climate-related hazards significantly affect agriculture and disproportionately impact those who are already disadvantaged due to factors such as poverty, discrimination, gender and income inequalities, and limited access to resources. Integrating workers’ health and decent work into the climate change impacts on agriculture is essential, as vulnerabilities exacerbate socio-economic disparities and increase climate risks. Without support for adaptation, these vulnerabilities can intensify.\nIn our work Climate change, decent work and workers’ health in Brazil: theoretical considerations, we highlighted the challenges, limitations, and knowledge gaps related to agricultural labour, worker health, and the increasing influence of climate change in Brazil.\nYou can read the PRESS RELEASE here!\n#WorkersHealth #HumanRights #DecentWork #ClimateAction #Brazil\n\nShare it on social media:"

His research explores how forced labour and deforestation in the Brazilian Legal Amazon are spatially expressed through unequal landscape transformations. He integrates GIS, satellite imagery, and socio-environmental indicators to assess correlations between land use, exploitation, and territorial injustice. He holds a degree in Architecture and Urbanism and is completing a Master’s in Environmental Sciences at the Federal University of Tocantins (UFT), where he investigates landscape as both product and instrument of the social production of space. His work reveals how Brazil’s colonial legacy is inscribed in spatial patterns of segregation, exploitation, and socio-environmental inequality. Since 2018, Pedro has worked as a researcher at the Instituto de Atenção às Cidades (IAC/UFT), where he has coordinated and contributed to planning and territorial management projects across urban and rural contexts. His experience includes the development of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (PlanMobs), Municipal Master Plans, Environmental Licensing Reports, and regional-scale masterplans. These initiatives integrate academic research, technical consultancy, and participatory methods to support democratic territorial governance and spatial justice."

Este encontro oferece um espaço rico para o diálogo inter e transdisciplinar.\nEstou ansioso para me conectar com participantes que estão repensando as relações entre humanos e meio ambiente.\nA apresentação se concentrará em 20 anos de dados de saúde e registros de escravidão moderna para identificar padrões entre áreas com maior incidência de doenças relacionadas a WASH e saúde ocupacional. Ele serve como um passo fundamental para identificar relações causais e melhorar mecanismos de vigilância e avaliações de risco. Ao integrar dados de saúde pública com inspeções trabalhistas, o estudo visa aumentar a cobertura das inspeções, promover a colaboração entre múltiplas partes interessadas e fortalecer os esforços para abordar a exploração trabalhista e as vulnerabilidades de saúde simultaneamente.\nSe você for participar, adoraria me conectar com você!\n\nCompartilhe em redes sociais:"

    "text": "Escravizado do Etanol\nO etanol é amplamente reconhecido como uma solução importante para reduzir as emissões de gases de efeito estufa no setor de transporte e combater as mudanças climáticas. Como segundo maior produtor de etanol, o Brasil desempenha um papel significativo na indústria global de biocombustíveis. Entretanto, apesar de seus benefícios ambientais, a produção de etanol levanta sérias preocupações em relação aos direitos trabalhistas, saúde ocupacional e justiça social. O relatório recente Escravizado do Etanol by Reportér Brasil highlights the exploitation and unsafe working conditions faced by sugarcane workers.\n\n“Trabalhadores mortos em queimadas, obrigados a dormir no chão, forçados a trabalhar por conta de dívidas ilegais impostas pelo empregador e até mesmo atingidos por agrotóxicos lançados de aviões estão entre as situações reportadas em canaviais ligados às suas operações.”\n\nMuitos trabalhadores são submetidos à servidão por dívidas e salários imprevisíveis devido a deduções injustas, pagando suas próprias viagens, acomodações e alimentação. Além disso, horários de trabalho extremos e a falta de contratos formais negam aos trabalhadores o acesso a benefícios essenciais da previdência social. Alguns trabalhadores relatam dormir apenas quatro horas por noite, pois longos deslocamentos e turnos exaustivos impossibilitam um descanso adequado. Além disso, os trabalhadores da cana-de-açúcar são frequentemente expostos a pesticidas perigosos, sofrem esforços físicos intensos e correm altos riscos de doenças relacionadas ao calor.\n\n“Durante resgate ocorrido em fazendas de cinco municípios de Goiás e Minas Gerais, trabalhadores relataram aos fiscais que foram atingidos por agrotóxicos. Na foto, tirada pelo celular de um deles, é possível ver o avião que supostamente realizou a pulverização”\n\n\n\n\nFonte: Escravizado do Etanol. Trabalhadores relataram aos inspetores que foram pulverizados com pesticidas\n\n\nEnfrentar esses desafios exige uma aplicação mais rigorosa das leis trabalhistas, maior responsabilização corporativa e melhor supervisão nas cadeias de suprimentos. Uma transição justa na indústria do etanol deve priorizar não apenas a sustentabilidade ambiental, mas também a proteção dos direitos e do bem-estar dos trabalhadores. Governos, empresas e instituições financeiras devem tomar medidas decisivas para eliminar a escravidão moderna, garantir salários justos e fornecer condições de trabalho seguras. O etanol pode ser uma alternativa de combustível mais limpa, mas não deve ser feito à custa de vidas humanas, dignidade e direitos trabalhistas fundamentais.\n\n\nShare it on social media:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusoCC BY 4.0"

Por outro lado, a formulação, o monitoramento e a avaliação de programas, projetos e políticas públicas são processos que exigem informações. Nesse contexto, a iniciativa SmarlLab surgiu para construir conhecimento relevante para políticas públicas de promoção do trabalho decente com o uso de um recurso público de baixíssimo custo: dados públicos abertos. A iniciativa conjunta do MPT e da OIT Brasil deu origem à Plataforma SmartLab, que tem fortalecido a cooperação com organizações governamentais, não-governamentais e internacionais que atuam na promoção dessa agenda e que precisam de informações para tomar decisões sobre as ações que desenvolvem. Por meio de Observatórios Digitais, a plataforma beneficia também a comunidade científica, que passa a ter acesso a informações com facilidade sem precedentes para pesquisa. Além disso, o fluxo público de informações para tomada de decisões baseadas em evidências e orientadas para resultados beneficia a sociedade civil em geral."

    "text": "Project idea\nThis research will advance our understanding of the relationship between climate change, occupational health, and decent work, in the case of Brazilian agriculture, in partnership with Universidade Federal Fluminense. The project will produce a worker-informed, data-driven climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) for agricultural workers in Brazil concerning climate hazards. It will assess how indecent work practices exacerbate vulnerability and decrease occupational health. The project provides valuable insights towards developing targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies by applying a multi-layer risk assessment approach that integrates climate models, socio-economic data, and qualitative data from participatory methods such as worker voice data. This project supports the broader aspirations for achieving decent work conditions, as set out in UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, and linked with SDG 3, improving agricultural workers’ overall health and well-being.\nFunder: British Academy’s ODA Challenge-Oriented Research Grants 2024 Programme Duration: 18 months (June 24 to Dec 25)\nRights Lab project lead: Edgar Rodríguez-Huerta Programme: Measurement and Geographies\n\nProject press release\n\n\nThis is an example to check website\n\n\nCompartilhe esta publicação nas redes sociais::"

    "text": "Hoje, na #COP30, o tema Saúde, Trabalho, Justiça e Direitos Humanos destaca como esses tópicos estão profundamente interligados. Os efeitos dos riscos climáticos afetam significativamente a agricultura e impactam desproporcionalmente aqueles que já se encontram em situação de vulnerabilidade devido a fatores como pobreza, discriminação, desigualdades de gênero e de renda, e acesso limitado a recursos. Integrar a saúde dos trabalhadores e o trabalho decente aos impactos das mudanças climáticas na agricultura é essencial, visto que as vulnerabilidades exacerbam as disparidades socioeconômicas e aumentam os riscos climáticos. Sem apoio à adaptação, essas vulnerabilidades podem se intensificar.\nEm nosso trabalho Mudanças climáticas, trabalho decente e saúde dos trabalhadores no Brasil: considerações teóricas, destacamos os desafios, as limitações e as lacunas de conhecimento relacionados ao trabalho agrícola, à saúde dos trabalhadores e à crescente influência das mudanças climáticas no Brasil.\nVocê pode ler o COMUNICADO DE IMPRENSA aqui!\n#SaúdeDoTrabalhador #DireitosHumanos #TrabalhoDecente #AçãoClimática #Brasil\n\nCompartilhe em redes sociais:"
