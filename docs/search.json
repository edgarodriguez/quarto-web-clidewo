    "text": "Project idea\nThis research will advance our understanding of the relationship between climate change, occupational health, and decent work, in the case of Brazilian agriculture, in partnership with Universidade Federal Fluminense. The project will produce a worker-informed, data-driven climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) for agricultural workers in Brazil concerning climate hazards. It will assess how indecent work practices exacerbate vulnerability and decrease occupational health. The project provides valuable insights towards developing targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies by applying a multi-layer risk assessment approach that integrates climate models, socio-economic data, and qualitative data from participatory methods such as worker voice data. This project supports the broader aspirations for achieving decent work conditions, as set out in UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, and linked with SDG 3, improving agricultural workers’ overall health and well-being.\nFunder: British Academy’s ODA Challenge-Oriented Research Grants 2024 Programme Duration: 18 months (June 24 to Dec 25)\nRights Lab project lead: Edgar Rodríguez-Huerta Programme: Measurement and Geographies\n\nProject press release\n\n\nThis is an example to check website"

Entretanto, raramente esses dados se transformam em informações úteis à tomada de decisões a respeito de questões de alta complexidade que marcam a atualidade e que exigem intervenções baseadas em evidências e orientadas para resultados. Por outro lado, a formulação, o monitoramento e a avaliação de programas, projetos e políticas públicas são processos que exigem informações. Nesse contexto, a iniciativa SmarlLab surgiu para construir conhecimento relevante para políticas públicas de promoção do trabalho decente com o uso de um recurso público de baixíssimo custo: dados públicos abertos. A iniciativa conjunta do MPT e da OIT Brasil deu origem à Plataforma SmartLab, que tem fortalecido a cooperação com organizações governamentais, não-governamentais e internacionais que atuam na promoção dessa agenda e que precisam de informações para tomar decisões sobre as ações que desenvolvem. Por meio de Observatórios Digitais, a plataforma beneficia também a comunidade científica, que passa a ter acesso a informações com facilidade sem precedentes para pesquisa. Além disso, o fluxo público de informações para tomada de decisões baseadas em evidências e orientadas para resultados beneficia a sociedade civil em geral."

It establishes the overall relationship between climate change risk and working conditions, relevant international legal standards and norms on worker rights, and the features of worker conditions in Brazilian agriculture. It offers a compelling research agenda with five operational pillars: (1) research, (2) surveillance and monitoring, (3) risk assessment, (4) risk management, and (5) policies and regulations. The more holistic framework developed here avoids monocausal explanations and solutions, incomplete and fragmented interventions, and multiple unintended consequences in ways that can bring real impact to the livelihoods and health of Brazilian agricultural workers."

    "text": "SmartLab\n\nSmartLab\n\nGovernos de todo o mundo produzem grandes quantidades de dados relevantes para políticas públicas. Entretanto, raramente esses dados se transformam em informações úteis à tomada de decisões a respeito de questões de alta complexidade que marcam a atualidade e que exigem intervenções baseadas em evidências e orientadas para resultados. Por outro lado, a formulação, o monitoramento e a avaliação de programas, projetos e políticas públicas são processos que exigem informações. Nesse contexto, a iniciativa SmarlLab surgiu para construir conhecimento relevante para políticas públicas de promoção do trabalho decente com o uso de um recurso público de baixíssimo custo: dados públicos abertos. A iniciativa conjunta do MPT e da OIT Brasil deu origem à Plataforma SmartLab, que tem fortalecido a cooperação com organizações governamentais, não-governamentais e internacionais que atuam na promoção dessa agenda e que precisam de informações para tomar decisões sobre as ações que desenvolvem. Por meio de Observatórios Digitais, a plataforma beneficia também a comunidade científica, que passa a ter acesso a informações com facilidade sem precedentes para pesquisa. Além disso, o fluxo público de informações para tomada de decisões baseadas em evidências e orientadas para resultados beneficia a sociedade civil em geral."

    "text": "Project idea\nThis research will advance our understanding of the relationship between climate change, occupational health, and decent work, in the case of Brazilian agriculture, in partnership with Universidade Federal Fluminense. The project will produce a worker-informed, data-driven climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) for agricultural workers in Brazil concerning climate hazards. It will assess how indecent work practices exacerbate vulnerability and decrease occupational health. The project provides valuable insights towards developing targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies by applying a multi-layer risk assessment approach that integrates climate models, socio-economic data, and qualitative data from participatory methods such as worker voice data. This project supports the broader aspirations for achieving decent work conditions, as set out in UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, and linked with SDG 3, improving agricultural workers’ overall health and well-being.\nFunder: British Academy’s ODA Challenge-Oriented Research Grants 2024 Programme Duration: 18 months (June 24 to Dec 25)\nRights Lab project lead: Edgar Rodríguez-Huerta Programme: Measurement and Geographies\n\nProject press release\n\n\nThis is an example to check website"
