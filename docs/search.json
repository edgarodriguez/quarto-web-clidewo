    "text": "Biography\nDr. Jeffrey Girard studies how emotions are expressed through verbal and nonverbal behavior, as well as how interpersonal communication is influenced by individual differences (e.g., personality and mental health) and social factors (e.g., culture and context). This work is deeply interdisciplinary and draws insights and tools from various areas of social science, computer science, statistics, and medicine.\nHe completed his doctoral training under the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Cohn (nonverbal behavior, machine learning, depression) and Dr. Aidan Wright (interpersonal functioning, statistics, personality). He then completed his predoctoral clinical internship at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (inpatient psychiatry, trauma treatment, neuropsychology) and a two-year postdoctoral research fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University under the mentorship of Dr. Louis-Philippe Morency (verbal behavior, machine learning, computer science).\nHe is now an Assistant Professor in the department of Psychology at the University of Kansas, where he directs the Affective Communication and Computing lab and the Brain, Behavior, and Quantitative Science (BBQ) program. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on psychological assessment, data science, and statistics within the department and is a co-founder of SMaRT Workshops, which offers numerous methodological training workshops to faculty and students. He is also the developer and maintainer of numerous open-source research software packages (see Resources)."

    "text": "Why Distill and giscus?\nLike many R-bloggers these days, I have made some changes: I switched from blogdown to Distill 2, and from disqus to utterances 3. Several things about utterances appealed to me: free, open-source, no data tracking. But when I started using it, I immediately was turned off by the dual use of GitHub issues as a way to store comments. It just felt odd to have an issue that wasn’t an issue!\nFortunately, I’m not the only one to feel this way, and @laymonage actually did something about it: there is now a very similar app to utterances, called giscus. It offers almost the same functionality, but it uses GitHub Discussions as the place to store comments instead of Issues. This makes much more sense to me."

    "text": "How to set up giscus on Distill\nThere are several blogposts 4 on how to enable utterances on Distill, but none that I’ve found so far on giscus. So, here goes!\n\nEnable Discussions on your blog repo. Optionally, if you want to use a non-default Discussions category for storing giscus content, add a new category. I did this and called it “Comments”. As recommended by giscus, it’s a good idea to set the discussion format to “Announcement” so that non-authorized users can’t add content via the Discussions interface (only the giscus widget on your blog).\nInstall the giscus GitHub app and configure it to have access to your blog’s repo.\nGo to the giscus app interface, scroll down to “configuration” and fill in the details for your blog. Once you’ve done so, further down you should see an HTML code block under “Enable giscus” populated with your information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 2: giscus configuration menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 3: giscus HTML block. Once you fill in the fields in the configuration menu, the parts starting with [ENTER ...] will get automatically populated.\n\n\n\nAs described in Miles McBain’s blogpost, unfortunately in Distill, you can’t just paste the HTML directly into an Rmd file. It won’t show up. But the same work-around that he describes for utterances also happily works for giscus!

Several things about utterances appealed to me: free, open-source, no data tracking. But when I started using it, I immediately was turned off by the dual use of GitHub issues as a way to store comments. It just felt odd to have an issue that wasn’t an issue!\nFortunately, I’m not the only one to feel this way, and @laymonage actually did something about it: there is now a very similar app to utterances, called giscus. It offers almost the same functionality, but it uses GitHub Discussions as the place to store comments instead of Issues. This makes much more sense to me."

    "text": "How to set up giscus on Distill\nThere are several blogposts 4 on how to enable utterances on Distill, but none that I’ve found so far on giscus. So, here goes!\n\nEnable Discussions on your blog repo. Optionally, if you want to use a non-default Discussions category for storing giscus content, add a new category. I did this and called it “Comments”. As recommended by giscus, it’s a good idea to set the discussion format to “Announcement” so that non-authorized users can’t add content via the Discussions interface (only the giscus widget on your blog).\nInstall the giscus GitHub app and configure it to have access to your blog’s repo.\nGo to the giscus app interface, scroll down to “configuration” and fill in the details for your blog. Once you’ve done so, further down you should see an HTML code block under “Enable giscus” populated with your information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: giscus configuration menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: giscus HTML block.

    "text": "What we provide\nResources are created to meet the needs of our target audiences. These include:\n\nCase studies – showing how data science is used to solve real-world problems in business, public policy and beyond.\nExplainers – interrogating the underlying assumptions and limitations of data science tools and methods, to help data scientists make smarter, more informed analytical choices.\nExercises – to challenge and develop the analytical mindset that all data scientists need to succeed.\n\nAdvice – interviews, Q&As, and FAQs on such topics as data science ethics, career paths, and communication, to support professional development.\n\nWe are also curating resources to help data scientists identify trustworthy, high-quality content. These include:\n\nTraining guides – step-by-step approaches and recommended sources for learning new skills and methods.\nDatasets – tagged and sorted to help educators and practitioners find data to meet their teaching and training needs.\nFeeds – who and what to follow to keep up with new ideas and developments.\n\nClimate Change, Occupational Health, and Decent Work: Worker Vulnerabilities and Response in Brazilian Agriculture\nThis research will advance our understanding of the relationship between climate change and decent work, including worker health, working conditions, and worker vulnerability in the case of Brazil. In general, the impact of climate change on decent work is most acute in the agricultural sector, where Brazil represents a typical case as it is a large exporter of agricultural goods. The project will produce a worker-informed, data- driven climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) for agricultural workers in Brazil with respect to climate hazards and will assess how indecent work practices exacerbate vulnerability and decrease occupational health. By applying an innovative multi-layer risk assessment approach that integrates climate models, socio-economic data, and qualitative worker voice data, the project provides valuable insights towards the development of targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies. This project supports the broader aspirations for achieving decent work conditions, as set out in UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8."
