## [Social Progress Index](https://ipsbrasil.org.br/en/)

The Social Progress Index (SPI) is a methodology that assesses the quality of life of Brazil's population through a multidimensional approach. The SPI examines whether people have the necessary resources to thrive, moving beyond traditional metrics and economic paradigms, and enables comparisons among municipalities, states, and regions.
