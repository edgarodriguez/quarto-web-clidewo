## [Climate-Conflict Vulnerability Index](https://climate-conflict.org/www)

CCVI metrics are organized hierarchically into three pillars — climate, conflict and vulnerability.
Each pillar is based on indicators from publicly available sources, which are grouped by dimensions.
Following the IPCC definition, risk metrics are computed as a function of risks, exposure and vulnerability.
