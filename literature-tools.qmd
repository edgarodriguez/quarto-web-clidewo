## Literature review and analysis tools

Part of our goals is to open up new ways of sharing information and learning during all stages of the project, including the process of collecting references, literature review, and discussion among the team.

The following are some proposed tools. We are still in the process of identifying which tools are most effective for our purpose and that fit the project workflow. So, this could evolve in the future.

## Alphaxiv

[alphaXiv.org](https://www.alphaxiv.org) is an online platform designed for open and collaborative discussion on research papers published on arXiv. It allows users to leave comments directly on specific lines within a paper, fostering a more focused and insightful conversation.

#### How we will use Alphaxiv

As an open access tool, we will include analyses related to our literature review and the process during the development of the methodological framework. We also believe that it will be a powerful tool for collaborating with other stakeholders during the project.

## Literature review networks

[ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai) is a free online â€œcitation-based literature mapping tool." It is a visual literature review software mapping tool. The tool connects your research interests to related articles and authors. 

#### How we will use ResearchRabbit

We will share our collections of quotes and leave it open to the community to collaborate to identify gaps and strengthen data collection.

See our collection in Research Rabbit: [Collection (in process)](https://www.researchrabbitapp.com/collection/public/0LJ1DNE86W)


## Data science tools and R packages

Code for CRVA integration will be included to facilitate reproducibility of the project.
