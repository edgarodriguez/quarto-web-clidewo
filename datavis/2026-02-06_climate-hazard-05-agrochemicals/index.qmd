## Effect of agrochemicals workers' health

Agricultural workers are often exposed to agrochemicals (like pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers) through skin contact, inhalation, or contaminated food and water. This exposure can cause short-term health effects such as skin irritation, eye problems, headaches, nausea, and breathing difficulties. Long-term exposure is more serious and has been linked to chronic respiratory diseases, hormonal disruption, reproductive problems, nerve damage, and increased risk of certain cancers. Limited protective equipment and lack of training can increase these health risks for workers.

### Our Agrochemicals Score


Agrochemicals score is estimated by integrating two indicators: Application of pesticides [^2], and Pesticides Risk Score [^3].


Data visualization summarizes the analysis of excessive heat in **Brazil**, disaggregated by **municipality, population, and crops**, to identify spatial differences and heat stress hotspots across dimensions. By translating complex climate and socio-environmental data into accessible visual formats, data visualization supports better decision-making, enabling targeted interventions, risk prioritization, and policies that advance decent work in agriculture.
