::: {.callout-note}

During work inspections, inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) have been identified as major issues and contribute to degrading working conditions.

:::


## WASH

**Short-term health effects** include dehydration, heat exhaustion, heat cramps, reduced cognitive function, and increased risk of occupational injuries due to fatigue and impaired concentration. These immediate impacts can lower productivity and raise accident rates, often without adequate access to rest, shade, or potable water.

**Long-term exposure** to excessive heat is associated with chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular strain, worsening respiratory conditions, and long-lasting impacts on mental health. Repeated heat stress can also accelerate physical wear, shorten working lives, and increase economic insecurity among already vulnerable workers.

Addressing heat stress through regulation, social protection, and workplace adaptation is essential to ensure decent work, protect health, and sustain agricultural livelihoods in a warming climate.

### WASH measure


WASH score is estimated based on Variations in water availability as a function of water scarcity, from the interaction between the hydrological system and climate variability [^2] 6
Diseases related to inadequate environmental sanitation (100k inhabitants) [^3] 4
Variations in water availability as a function of water scarcity, from the interaction between the hydrological system and climate variability [^1] 6


Data visualization summarizes the analysis of excessive heat in **Brazil**, disaggregated by **municipality, population, and crops**, to identify spatial differences and heat stress hotspots across dimensions. By translating complex climate and socio-environmental data into accessible visual formats, data visualization supports better decision-making, enabling targeted interventions, risk prioritization, and policies that advance decent work in agriculture.
