## Dengue in Brazil 

In 2024, Brazil exceeded its worst-case projection for dengue cases in June 2024, with a record 5.5 million infections reported, representing a 240 per cent increase from the 1.6 million cases recorded in 2023, which was already among the highest on record[^2]

### Our vector-borne diseases Score


**Vector-borne diseases** score is estimated by integrating Climate Hazard Index (Health) related to the occurrence of dengue, zika and chikungunya arboviruses (mean sceanrio for 2030)[^3], Incidence of dengue per 100,000 inhabitants[^4] 


Data visualization summarizes the analysis of excessive heat in **Brazil**, disaggregated by **municipality, population, and crops**, to identify spatial differences and exposure to vector-borne dieases (dengue) hotspots across dimensions. By translating complex climate and socio-environmental data into accessible visual formats, data visualization supports better decision-making, enabling targeted interventions, risk prioritization, and policies that advance decent work in agriculture.

Vector-borne diseases is one of the main risks to workers' health related to climate change and the environment[^1]
