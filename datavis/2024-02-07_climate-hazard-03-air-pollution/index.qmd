## Effect of air pollution workers' health

Cancer (lung), respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease [^1]


### Our Air pollution Score

Air pollution hazard was estimated using the annual mean concentration of fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) from Global inequality in environmental conditions[^2]  . Air quality was normalised using a piecewise, risk-based scaling approach, in which the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline value of 5 µg/m³ for annual PM₂.₅ was assigned a hazard score of 50 (high risk), and maximum value in Brazil (38.78) as 100, 

Data visualization summarizes the analysis of excessive heat in **Brazil**, disaggregated by **municipality, population, and crops**, to identify spatial differences and heat stress hotspots across dimensions. By translating complex climate and socio-environmental data into accessible visual formats, data visualization supports better decision-making, enabling targeted interventions, risk prioritization, and policies that advance decent work in agriculture.
